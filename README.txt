Search is a project developed to the course "CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript".

"Seach" is a page that uses html and css to perform searches using google, allowing the adaptation of searches, visuals and advanced options, in order to better meet the needs of those who do recurring searches on the platform but would need some changes to facilitate their routine.

Although it is a base page for future adaptations, the project already has a functional version for the standard search in addition to advanced searches such as: "All of these words", "Any of these words", "This exact word or phrase" and "None of these words".

Listed below are all the files that I have contributed code to and what is contained in those files:
- index.html : this file contains the principal page.
- images.html : this file contains the image page used to search images related to written text.
- advanced.html : in the advanced file are the search filters.
- style.css : It is the style configuration file used in the application, containing the body, images and cards settings.

How to run your application. To run the application it is necessary to keep all files in the same folder and open the index.html file.
